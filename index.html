                The capybara, sometimes referred to by its scientific name of <em>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</em>, is
                the largest rodent on Earth. It primarily lives in South America, but can be found in zoos all over
                the world. It is closely related to guinea pigs, which is easier to see in younger capybaras. It is
                a highly social animal, and can be found in groups as large as 100. Though, groups of up to 10
                are more common.

                <p>
                    The name <em>capybara</em> is derived from the Tupi word <em>ka'api√ªara</em>. Tupi is a now
                    extinct language which was used by the Tupi people living in Brazil. Translated, this word means
                    'one who
                    eats slender leaves' or 'grass-eater'.<br>Its scientific name, <em>Hydrochoerus
                        hydrochaeris</em>, is derived from the Greek words <em>hydro</em> meaning 'water' and
                    <em>choiros</em> meaning 'pig'. So one could also call them 'water pigs'.

                The capybara is found primarily in South America. It appears in most of Brazil, as well as parts of Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. Most of the time, it'll be in or near the water. It likes to sleep in in the morning and usually goes out for food in the afternoon and evening. It can also swim, which is when you'll see it with just the top of its face sticking out above the water.

                The capybara is a herbivore. It mainly eats plants near and in the water. The typical adult capybara can eat around 3 kilograms (6.6 lbs) of grass in a single day. It also eats its own feces after, which helps it digest the grass. In cases where no grass is available, it'll settle for reeds, melons and grains.

                The capybara is not an endangered animal, and as such it is hunted by quite a few people. The humans living near hunt it, as the capybara eats and destroys their crops. Some people also hunt them for their fur, oils and sometimes meat. The capybara is considered a delicacy in some countries, including Venezuela.
